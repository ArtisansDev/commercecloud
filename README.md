## artisans Website

This is a static website hosted on Vercel.

### Notes
- Removal of html extensions is good for the SEO, hence done. It works in the live site as we are using Vercel which ensures that the pages render even without the HTML extension.

### Content for Meta tags
- Use ChatGPT to generate meta tags. (Ref link - https://chatgpt.com/share/6728f259-20a8-8006-a889-6e4e8971e650)
- You can use [this site](https://totheweb.com/learning_center/tools-convert-html-text-to-plain-text-for-content-review/) for extracting text from the webpage. (another [option](https://toolsyep.com/en/webpage-to-plain-text/))
